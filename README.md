# setup

MacOS setup.
Will install:
- iterm2 (and import my settings)
- brew
- oh-my-zsh
- [pure theme](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure)
- [git credentials manager](https://github.com/GitCredentialManager/git-credential-manager/blob/main/README.md)
- [ollama](https://ollama.com/)

Remember to restart iterm2 at the end of the script execution, for the ~/.zshrc file to save.
